1)Difference between static linking and dynamic linking
Static Linking
----------------
Definition:

The process of copying library code into the executable at compile time.
Characteristics:

The program is self-contained; no external library dependencies are required at runtime.
The library code becomes part of the final executable file.

Dynamic Linking
-----------------
Definition:

The process of linking library code to a program at runtime, rather than compile time.
Characteristics:

The program depends on external shared libraries (e.g., .dll, .so) at runtime.
Only references to the library code are included in the executable.
